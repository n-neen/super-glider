        all background tilemaps are 32x32 but only need to be 32x28
            this will save $100 bytes per tilemap

    bugs: {
        candle object spawns flame enemy, but the routine has to run three times before it actually works (lmao)
        tablepole object takes an extra frame to draw
            if we handle objects twice during room load it doesn't happen. weird
        table in room $20 takes an extra frame to draw
            but only when starting the game
    }
