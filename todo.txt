    enemies: {
        basketball
        toaster
        the cat
        
        duct:
        property3 to be used for output y pos?

    objects: {
        tv
        microwave
        filing cabinet
        hip-pole lamp
        cabinet?
        dresser?
        
        move window to common graphics section? (stairs area)
    }
    
    backgrounds: {
        library     ;not really possible without redrawing a bunch of it
    }
    
    other: {
        improve title screen
        options, menus
        all background tilemaps are 32x32 but only need to be 32x28
            this will save $100 bytes per tilemap
        
        implement sprite index constant defines in defines.asm
            for loading.asm
            
        implement !enemyone, !enemytwo defines
        !kenemyone = $0028
        !kenemytwo = $0026
        etc
        useful for switches
        
        consider expanding room data to include respawn heights
            one byte each for left, right
            if 0 then ignore, and use old system
            
        add object init routines
            look at existing types which will benefit from this
                fishbowl
                shelf
                candle
                objects which delete themselves?
                    unless they need to draw first
    }
    
    room: {
        copter in room 21 needs to be moved away from duct (die on entering room from it)
            this may be fixed due to the recent duct transition changes dec 21st 2025
                ducts no longer have stairslift movement at all (table still gets read but it's 0)
    }
    
    bugs: {
        candle object spawns flame enemy, but the routine has to run three times before it actually works (lmao)
        
        tablepole object takes an extra frame to draw
            if we handle objects twice during room load it doesn't happen. weird
            
        table in room $20 takes an extra frame to draw
            but only when starting the game
            
        switches acting on enemies or objects in the same room is pretty broken
            ok it kinda works but it can desync ugh
            
        because grease is an enemy, you cannot land on grease when you have iframes
            this is fixed. we have a list of enemies allowed to ignore iframes now
                located at enemy_collision_iframeskip
    }
