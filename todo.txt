        property3 to be used for output y pos?

    other: {
        improve title screen
        options, menus
        all background tilemaps are 32x32 but only need to be 32x28
            this will save $100 bytes per tilemap
        
        implement sprite index constant defines in defines.asm

        copter in room 21 needs to be moved away from duct (die on entering room from it)
    }
    
    bugs: {
        candle object spawns flame enemy, but the routine has to run three times before it actually works (lmao)
        
        tablepole object takes an extra frame to draw
            if we handle objects twice during room load it doesn't happen. weird
            
        table in room $20 takes an extra frame to draw
            but only when starting the game
            
        switches acting on enemies or objects in the same room is pretty broken
            ok it kinda works but it can desync ugh
    }
