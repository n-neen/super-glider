            change bounds from $1001 to something like
            %0000000000000011
            i.e.
            $0001   right bound
            $0002   left bound
            to maximize the other space that can be used

    room: {
        combine room bg and bounds into a single word
        and leave the other word unused
        possibly for use as a pointer to a routine to run
    }
    
    bugs: {
        dynamic enemy spawning palette bug  <----------- i think this is fixed
        candle object spawns flame enemy, but the routine has to run three times before it actually works (lmao)
    }
