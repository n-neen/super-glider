;object setup

varitable: {
    ;example object list entry: 
    ;object type            x pos, y pos,  palette,  xxyy
    dw #obj_ptr_varitable,  $0006, $000b,  $0800,   $0803
    last word (variable) is xxyy, where:
        xx = x size (width of tabletop)
        yy = y size (height of pole)
    
    object varitable spawns three dependant objects:
    tabletop, tablepole, tablebase
    uses dynamic object tilemap array as a buffer to draw tilemap
}

openwall: {
    variable:
        $8000 = left
        $0000 = right
}

windows: {
    can only be properly used in:
        bg2, bg3, bg4, bg5, bg6, bg9
        
        bg7 could work but we have to move the fireplace (whoops)
}

ozma: {
    can only be properly used in bg3
}

fireplace: {
    can only be properly used in bg7
}
